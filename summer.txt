My name is Tim Skinner and all I did over the summer was work 40 hours every week and sleep the rest of the time.



My name is Michael Himes and this summer I had an internship at Ontario Systems in Muncie. I worked 40 hours per week and didn't get to do much else. However, I think the internship was a good experience for me and I think I gained a lot from it.
